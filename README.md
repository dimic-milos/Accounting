EXAMPLE 1:

Farmer needs fertilizers, or seed for his field so he decides to make a contract to finance his purchase. Contract states that he will sell his future production to the company in order to clear his debt.

Making a new contract with the farmer is easy. User selects previously entered article from the picker, enters the quantity and packiging. User selects goods in which the farmer pays out his depbt and date picker automatically sets to predefined date. This date can also be manually altered. Exchange rate is saved for the currency selected in order to calculate further value of the contract.

If the contract is in domestic currency, exchanger rate is not being calculated in, it can be turned off by moving the switch to off position. Farmer has to clear his debt on time, otherwise interest on his unpaid portion of the contract value is being calculated in. This is optional so there is another switch to turn off this option.
